  ## Description
  This project is a Readme file generator built using Node.js. The user is prompted for project information with questions in the terminal, which will then be used to generate a README.md file for their project.

  ## Technologies used
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * Node.js

  ## Installation
  First, clone or download this repository to wherever you'd like on your own local machine. Next, using the command line, navigate to the root of the application. Then, `cd` into the `Develop` directory, and once there, run the command `npm install` or `npm i`. After our dependencies have been installed, run the command `node index.js` to start the application.

  ## How to Use
  Once the user starts the application, they will be asked to enter the name of their project and to describe it. Then they will be asked if they would like to include an optional table of contents. Following this, users will then be asked to elaborate on how others can install their project and how to use the project. Users will then be asked to list any contributors to the project, and how others can test it. Next, users are given the option to include a license for their project. Finally, users are asked to enter their GitHub name and their email address so that others can reach out to them with questions.
